# Snake

This is a little snake implementation in Rust by @xfbs and @danielhe. It's a little shitty, but playable.

To run it, you need to have Rust installed, you can do so by going to <https://rustup.rs/> and following instructions.

Use `cargo` to compile and run it:

    cargo run

Have fun and happy snaking.
